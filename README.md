# Animal Classification
This project analyzes a dataset that contains images of multiple endangered animals, and aims to correctly identify what animal an image shows, using a Convolution Neural Network as the model. With the goal being having a model be able to identify an animal based on an image, we hoped that this could potentially help assist wildlife organizations in their conservation efforts with the uage of this tool.
